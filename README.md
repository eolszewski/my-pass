Soverign Idenitity for Urban Survivors 

## Getting Started

Start local Ethereum and IPFS nodes.

```
docker-compose up

npm run start
npm run build
npm run deploy

```

## Decentralization

This PoC makes heavy use of Google Cloud Platform, including Firebase Mobile Backend as a Service.

The App also uses Ethereum and IPFS. In the future, users could be rewarded for hosting each others files, but for now, we'll rely on client side encryption and reliable centralized storage providers.
